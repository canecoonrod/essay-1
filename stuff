<p>At the beginning of limbo, the first thing you see that makes noise other than what you directly interact with is the flies around the rotting carcass.</p>

<p>This was particularly interesting to stumble upon, as it was the first indicator that something other than your character actually exists outside of you in the current 
world. What we would normally see as just another obstacle to avoid is actually something that gives away a lot about the world around our character. In relation to emotion,
this is the first time we feel fearful rather than anxious. We now have actual confirmation that there are living things, and this is when all of the tiny details along the 
way start to make sense. The snapped trees, the bear traps, the remains of buildings and mechanisms that have long been abandoned, are all tiny details that one would assume
are insignificant details, yet they are crucial to helping you become immersed. This quote from Barth is particularly interesting in this case. "The general structure of 
narrative, at least as it has been occasionally analyzed till now, appears as essentially predictive; schematizing to the extreme, and without taking into account numerous 
detours, delays, reversals, and disappointments which narrative institutionally imposes upon this schema." </p>
